<h3>Cat manager</h3>

This study project was created following the "Tour of Heroes" tutorial on the Angular official page (<a href="https://angular.io/tutorial">here</a>).

It slightly extends the example app's functionality (my "cat" object has more fields than the example's "hero" object, and the user can choose a cat as "favourite", which affects what the page looks like, but is a preference only stored client-side and never saved to the server).

I have also created a real C# back-end app to serve it, instead of the mock version used in the tutorial.

CSS was not the focus of the project, and copying the existing styles from the tutorial would have felt a bit deceitful, so I wrote just enough CSS for the app to be functional. The one exception where I have used the tutorial's stylings is the "dashboard" page.
